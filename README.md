## Developing Process
We began by developing the features for our app based on the design we created in Figma. Once the features were implemented, we focused on enhancing the layout and UI elements to improve the app's appearance. Finally, we presented the finished app to our team for collaborative testing. During this phase, we identified and fixed various bugs and errors, continuously testing and refining the app to improve its performance. While the app may not be perfect, we have dedicated our best efforts to its development.
